# Details of stolen authenticode certificates used to sign malware.
#
# Legitimate certificates (e.g. not stolen ones) are in a separate file.
#
# When adding to the file please use the version reported by Yara.  See
# below for further info.
#
# TODO: Yara uses one version of the serial field but Windows displays
#       it differently.  Windows displays the hex which will appear in
#       the file.  Yara (through OpenSSL) may compute a different value,
#       perhaps where it is a negative number?
#
#       Consider ways to automatically convert serial into both possible
#       permutations.
